pnitools build and installation procedure
=========================================

pnitools uses cmake for installation. The following software should be installed
on your system before continuing with the build procedure

.) libpnicore >= 0.9.4
.) libpniio >= 0.9.4
.) cmake >= 2.6
.) texinfo 
.) doxygen

Along with this you need a recent C++ compiler (>=gcc4.4). 

Building the pnitools
=====================

As CMAKE is used for the build an out of place build is strongly recommended.
After unpacking the source archive create a new, empty build directory 

$> tar xf pnitools-0.1.0.tar.gz 
$> mkdir pnitools-build
$> cd pnitools-build

and run CMAKE in the build directory in order to configure the build

$> cmake

once CMAKE is finished with the configuration

$> make
$> make install

will build and install the software. The default installation prefix is
/usr/local. If you want to change this set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable
during build configuration. 

$> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/pnitools

This is currently the only option provided to take influence on the
installation. After 'make install' you will find the following directory
structure below PREFIX

PREFIX/bin                    - with all the executable programs
PREFIX/share/doc/man/man1     - the man pages of the individual programs
PREFIX/share/info             - will contain the texinfo documentation
PREFIX/share/doc/pnitools-doc - with the PDF documentation
