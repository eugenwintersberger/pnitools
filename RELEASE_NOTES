Release notes for version 0.3.0
===============================

detinfo
-------
  * program output has been changed
  * several output formats including CSV and XML have been added
  * added support for Nexus files (fixes issue 2)

nxls
----
  * by default only short output is shown (fixes issue 3)
  * added additional information with the long option (fixes issue 6)

det2nx
------
  * removed sanity check of input files - this operation is too expensive
  * det2nx cannot create the basic file structure anymore
    this should avoid incomplete Nexus files. Create the file where your 
    detector data should be dumped before for instance with xml2nx. 
    However, the field where the data shall be stored can still be 
    created by det2nx. See the info pages for a detailed description 
    of the new behavior of the program.
