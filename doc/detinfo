information. Currently the following file formats are supported
\n
\li CBF     the format used by DECTRIS for its PILATUS detectors
\li TIFF    general image format used by several detector vendors
\n

Files can be passed as a list of single files or using a C format string as a
name template and a numeric range. For details see the online documentation for
pnitools. \n\n

\section OPTIONS

\b -h, \b --help  \n
\t\t\t\t show help about  the program 

\b -v, \b --verbose \t activate verbose output mode

\b --full-path use the full path of a file instead of the filename only

\section EXAMPLES

The simplest application of the program would be this
\code
detinfo detecto.cbf
\endcode
