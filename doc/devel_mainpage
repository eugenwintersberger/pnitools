Welcome to the developer documentation for PNI tools. This documentation is
intended for developers only. It is thus entirely separate from the
documentation of the different programs. However, as a developers, you should
first read the documentation and become familiar with the different programs and
the philosophies they have in common.

The PNI tools are a collection of tools dedicated to handle data generated
during PNI experiments. This includes programs for modifying, viewing, as well
as importing and exporting data. The core data format supported by all tools is
the Nexus format. 

\section concepts Common operation concepts

As many of the programs share a common philosophy of how they treat data it is
worth to read this section before continuing with the reading the man page of a
particular program. It will safe you a lot of time and make the man pages more
instructive to you when you read this first. 

\subsection rois Managing Regions of Interest (ROIs)

A region of interest (ROI) defines a particular region in a 1D or a 2D detector.
If a program offers you the possibility to the specify one or several ROIs, whatever the
program will do will be restricted to these ROIs. 
ROIs are usually passed to a program by the \c -r or \c --roi command line
option. For instance, if you are interested only in the data stored between
channels 230 and 1025 of an MCA you can select this ROI with
\code
$> prog --roi=230:1026 ......some other options...
\endcode
which will cause the program to act only on the data from channel 230 to 1024
(the last value of the ROI is not included).
For 2D data the ROI can be set with
\code
$> prog -r230:1026,100:512 .....some other options....
\endcode
which will select data form pixel 230 to 1025 in the first and 100 to 511 in the
second dimension. In many cases you can pass several ROIs to the program. In
this case each ROI gets its own option. This is shown here for an MCA
\code
$> prog -r20:45 -r100:512 -r1024:1398 .....some other options...
\endcode

\subsection files Selecting files for input and output

In many cases a program acts on data stored in one or many files. The names of
files (usually used for input) are passed as command line arguments to the
program. In the simplest case you can just add the filename at the end of the
command line used to run the program
\code
$> prog ...options... input_file.dat
\endcode
If many files should be passed to a program one can use wildcards like this
\code
$> prog ...options... data/may_2012/exp_*.dat
\endcode
which will pass a list of command line arguments with all file names matching
the wildcar \c data/may_2012/exp_*.dat to the program. 
Until now we this is the behavior one would expect for any UNIX program. 
However, there is one case which needs a bit more care. 
In many cases you have to read a whole bunch of individual detector files into
your program. You might be tempted to use the wild card approach mentioned
before to do this. However, in this case you cannot be sure that the files are
passed in the appropriate order to your program. It depends on the shell how the
files are ordered if wild cards are used. 
In such a situation there are two approaches which can be used
\li use the  \c --input option whose value is the name of a file containing the
name of the files to read in the desired order
\li use a template and a numeric range to specify the input files. 

The first approach is rather straight forward: write the name of the files to an
ASCII file (lets say files.txt)  and then use
\code 
$> prog --input=files.txt ...other options....
\endcode
To tell the program which files to process. 

Though being very simple to understand using such an input file can be pretty
tedious in particular if the number of files is large. However, in many cases
where the order of the input files matters the filenames contain a number
determining the position of the file in the total list of files. 
Such a file typically looks like \c detector_may_2012_<NUMBER>.dat where
\c <NUMBER> is the index of the file in the list. 
In such a case the files can be described using the following syntax
\code
$> prog ...options... detector_may_2012_%05i.dat:100:1000
\endcode
This means that read all files following the pattern \c detector_may_2012_%05i.dat
starting from \c detector_may_2012_100.dat until \c detector_may_2012_1000.dat. 
Unlike for ROIs the last number is included. You can even do more sophisticated
things. Consider that you want only to read every second file from the list. In
this case the above example changes to
\code
$> prog ...options... detector_may_2012_%05i.dat:100:1000:2
\endcode
In general this follows the following syntax
\verbatim
    file_template:start:stop:stride
\endverbatim
where \c file_template is a C-format string (for integers). This is possible
because a colon must not appear as a part of a file or path name (at least not
on Unix systems). 

\subsection nexus_access Acessing objects in a Nexus file

Nexus files can be considered as a file-system in a file. Nexus as used here is
assumed to use HDF5 as a storage backend. 
If we would like to access an object in a file we can use the following syntax
\code
prog file:/path/to/object
\endcode
attributes attached to an object can be described with
\code
prog file:/path/to/object@attribute
\endcode
This syntax works when you know the exact path to a particular object. Aside
from object names Nexus introduces the concept of base classes. Each object in
a Nexus file belongs to one of these base classes. One can thus refine the path
to an object to
\code
prog file:/path:class_1/to:class_2/object:class_3
\endcode
In this case no only the names of the different objects must match but also
they must belong to a particular base class. 
Finally, if we do not know the exact path but only the classes we can write the
path only in terms of base classes
\code
prog file:/:class_1/:class_2/:class_3
\endcode
In this case the different types must be unique. In case of ambiguities the
program will abort with an error message.
