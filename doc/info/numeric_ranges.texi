In many cases the user is required to specify a range of integers. 
All programs in the @b{pnitools} distribution use a coherent syntax for this
purpose which is similar to how ranges are specified in Python. 
In its most general form the syntax reads

@example
    <start>:<stop>[:<stride>]
@end example

@noindent
where the last field (@emph{stride}) is optional. The fields have the following
meaning
@itemize
@item 
@emph{start} - the first number in the range
@item 
@emph{stop}  - the last number (not included in the range)
@item 
@emph{stride} - stride between the elements of the range
@end itemize

@noindent
Using this the range from @math{1} to @math{100} can be given with

@example
1:101 = 1,2,3,4,5,...,99,100
@end example

@noindent 
it is important to note that the last value is not included. To get only the
even numbers a stride of @math{2} can be added 

@example
2:101:2 = 2,4,6,8,10,...98,100
@end example

@noindent 
Possible applications of numeric ranges are for instance regions of interests or
series of file names that include a number.
