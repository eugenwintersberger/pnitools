@command{mcaops} is a program acting on MCA data. 


@command{mcaops} is a utility program applying certain operations on MCA data.
The MCA data can be either read from a file or from standard input. MCA data is
passed in two columns, the first containing the bin number or the bin center
value and the second the bin data. Actually only FIO file format is supported.

All results are written to standard output. This allows several @command{mcaops}
commands to be chained using the pipe operator. 

The behavior of @command{mcaops} is controlled via the command string which is
passed as the first argument to the program.  Currently the following commands
are available:
@table @samp
@item max     
find the value and its position in the spectrum
@item sum
add all value in the spectrum
@item rebin   
rebin the spectrum to new bin sizes
@item scale
scale the bin centers of the spectrum
@item dump
dump channel and mca data unchanged to standard out
@end table
@noindent
These operations can roughly devided into two groups: accumulating and
non-accumulating operations. The former one reduces the entire MCA data to a
single number while the latter one preserves the spectrum character of the data
(though rebining maybe alters the number of bins).

@subsection Program options

In general effect a particular option passed to @command{mcaops} has on the input data
depends on the operation that should be carried out. However, there are some
global options which always have the same effect on the behavior of the program
@table @samp
@item -h
@itemx --help
Print a usage message and exit.
@item -v
@itemx --verbose
Produce verbose output, printing information regarding the specified options and
objects.  All output is printed to standard error allowing you to redirect
payload data to an other program while still watching debugging output.
@item -q
@itemx --quiet
Suppress all unnecessary output (the counterpart of @option{-v})
@item --header
print a header before dumping the output to standard out
@item --xolumn=@var{COLNAME}
specify the name of the column to choose from the input to use as bin-center or
-index values. This option is only useful when used in connection with FIO
files.
@item --ycolumn=@var{COLNAME}
specify the name of the column to use for MCA data. This option is only useful
with a FIO file. 
@end table

@noindent
Options for the @command{rebin} operation
@table @samp
@item -b
@itemx --binsize=@var{NBINS}
defines the number of bins that should be collated during rebining. 
@item --noxrebin 
do not rebin the x-axis. Instead use indices for the output. 
@item --normalize 
normalize the rebinned data.
@end table

@noindent
Options for the  @command{scale} operation:
@table @samp
@item -c
@itemx --center=@var{CENTER}
defines the index of the center bin used for rescaling. 
@item -d
@itemx --delta=@var{DELTA}
defines the step width for the rebin operation
@item -x
@itemx --cvalue=@var{CENTERVALUE}
the value of the center bin.
@end table

@noindent
The @command{sum} and @command{max} command have no additional options.

@subsection Examples

Lets start with a very simple example reading data form standard input and using
the accumulating operations @command{sum} and @command{max}. For the sake of
convenience a data file should be created which looks like this
@example
0 1
1 0
2 10
3 50
4 100
5 200
6 70
7 150
8 20
9 1
10 0
@end example
and store the file as @file{test.dat}. Here the first column is the channel
index while the second holds the channel data.  
Plotting this data looks like this
@float
@center @image{gnuplot,,3in}
@end float

To compute the sum of the data
stored use
@example 
$ cat test.dat | mcaops sum 
602
@end example 
where the output, 602, is the sum of values stored in the second column.
Analogously, to find the maximum use
@example 
$> cat test.dat | mcaops max
5   200
@end example 
the two  numbers are the position of the maximum and its value respectively.
