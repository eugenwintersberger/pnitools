A region of interest (ROI) defines a particular region in a 1D or a 2D detector.
If a program offers you the possibility to the specify one or several ROIs,
whatever the program will do will be restricted to these ROIs.  ROIs are usually
passed to a program by the @option{-r} or @option{--roi} command line option. For instance,
if you are interested only in the data stored between channels 230 and 1025 of
an MCA you can select this ROI with

@example
$ prog --roi=230:1026 ......some other options...
@end example

@noindent which will cause the program to act only on the data from channel 230
to 1024. The last index 1024 is not included in the selection - this should
resemble the behavior of numpy slices which are well known by many scientists.

@noindent For 2D data the ROI can be set with

@example
$ prog -r230:1026,100:512 .....some other options....
@end example

@noindent which will select data form pixel 230 to 1025 in the first and 100 to
511 in the second dimension. In many cases you can pass several ROIs to the
program. In this case each ROI gets its own option. This is shown here for an
MCA (1D data)

@example
$ prog -r20:45 -r100:512 -r1024:1398 .....some other options...
@end example
