Remarks for Developers
======================

This directory contains the sources for the documentation of the pnitools
project. In this file the general documentation strategy is described. 
There are currently tow main sets of documentation available:

1.) user documentation 
2.) developer documentation

1.) user documentation
    ------------------

According to the GNU standard man-pages are considered as deprecated and should
no longer be used. Instead documentation should be provided as texinfo files. 
However, many users, including the author, like to use man-pages to quickly look
up the available command line options or return values provided by a program. To
get best of both worlds (texinfo and man-pages) and at the same time minimizing
the efforts the following strategy is suggested

.) the man pages provided contain only the basic information like a short 
   description along with the command line options, the return value of 
   the program, and reported bugs. Additionally contact information to the 
   author should be provided. Finally the man-page should encourage the user 
   to lookup the more detailed documentation provided by texinfo.

.) A full documentation of each program including also examples should be
   provided by texinfo. 

The pnitools.1 manpage should provide only a short description and mention the
texinfo documentation as the primary source of information. 

All further information like PDFs or HTML can be created directly from the
texinfo pages. 
The user documentation should be installed in locations common for documentation
on a specific platform.

2.) developer documentation
    -----------------------

The developer documentation should give a fellow programmer an overview over the
structure of the project and provided detailed information about the
implementation of the individual programs. Unlike the user documentation, this
set of information is not installed on a production system but remains in the
source tree within this directory. There is also no automatic build for the
documentation. You have to call 'doxygen' manually from within this directory. 
Doxygen will create a directory 'html' in this directory which contains the C++
class documentation.
