\brief moves detector data to a Nexus file

\section SYNOPSIS
\code
    det2nx [OPTIONS]... [FILES]...
\endcode

\section DESCRIPTION

\b det2nx stores single image data from detectors into a Nexus file. The data is
usually stored in a 2D or 3D data block where the first dimension runs along the
measurement points and the remaining two along the detector dimensions. 

In Nexus detector data is usually stored below a group of class NXdetector
which holds additional metadata along with the detector data. \b det2nx can
either create this detector group by itself using an XML file from which it
obtains the additional information or assumes that the detector group already
exists. If \b det2nx should not create the detector group by itself it checks if
the target group requested by the user if of class NXdetector and throws an
exception if this is not the case.

By default the detector data is stored in a field named data below the detector
group. 

\section OPTIONS

\b -c, \b --create create a not existing detector group
\b -g, \b --group=[xmlfile]  use this input data for detector group creation
\b -t, \b --target=[filepath] path to the detector group
\b -a, \b --append append data to an already existing detector data block
\b -o, \b --overwrite overwrite an existing data block 

Do not forget to run HDF5 repack on your Nexus file if you use the \b -o  option
as HDF5 cannot really delete objects. It just makes them inaccessible. To free
the disk-space occupied by such inaccessible object you need to run \b h5repack.
