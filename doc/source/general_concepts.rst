General concepts

Though all programs included in the pnitools distribution provide different
functionality they all share some common concepts which shall be described
here.  Read this chapter carefully before proceeding to the detailed
description of the individual programs. :program:`prog`, as used in the
following examples, is a placeholder for an arbitrary program from the
**pnitools** distribution.

In some situations a program can deviate from the common procedures described
in this section. In such a case the altered program behavior is explicitely
mentioned in the documentation.
