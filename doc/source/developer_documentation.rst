Developer documentation
=======================

Welcome to the developer documentation for PNI tools. This documentation is
intended for developers only. It is thus entirely separate from the
documentation of the different programs. However, as a developers, you should
first read the documentation and become familiar with the different programs and
the philosophies they have in common.

The PNI tools are a collection of tools dedicated to handle data generated
during PNI experiments. This includes programs for modifying, viewing, as well
as importing and exporting data. The core data format supported by all tools is
the Nexus format. 

This part of the documentation is only intended for developers of ``pnitools``.
As a normal user of the package there is nothing important here for you.
